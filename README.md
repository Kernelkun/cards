# Cards!

We love them.

## Quick setup

Install the dependencies:
```shell script
yarn
```

In one terminal, we are going to launch the web server:
```shell script
yarn start
```

In another terminal, we are going to launch the mocked server:
```shell script
yarn server
```

That's it, enjoy!

## Some available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn server`

Launches the json-server, thanks to the one, I can make network calls to get the data.

It's really cool and only takes 30 seconds to build up. Check it out! [Here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

There is no test right now, that's make me sad üò¢

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn prettier`

We can apply a pretty cool formatting style. This really shines when we work in a team, but I really love work with 
Prettier.

### `yarn eslint`

This is the AirBnb ESLint config. It's really strict, but I fell in love with it since I worked with it in a project.

### `yarn lint`

It's the final combo! I used to the pre-commit. Apply the format and check the lint before committing... A crime.

### `yarn plop`

Really cool tool, you can add all the templates you want to make new components, pages, services, reducers... Whatever 
you want. It's really helpful in every project, but it's shines when you want consistency in your code.

### `yarn storybook`

Ah! The good Storybook. The perfect tool to document all our components and make a great Design system. Unfortunately
I couldn't fill it with content, but it's enough for showing the tool and start talking about Design Systems.
